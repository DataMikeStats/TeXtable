#' TeXtable
#' 
#' TeXtable takes one or more lm or lme4::lmer tables and creates pretty LaTeX output.
#' 
#' Although packages like xtable exist, I have found them difficult to use.
#' I want a simple function that takes the two most common models that I use - lm and lmer - 
#' and outputs a TeX file that can be pasted into my manuscript (or compiled and pasted as 
#' an image if I'm working in Word).
#' 
#' Later, I'll modify the package to include glm and lme4::glmer.
